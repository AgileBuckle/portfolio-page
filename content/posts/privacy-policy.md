Here’s a simple, clear privacy policy suitable for a **personal-use phone service**. You can copy and paste this and adjust names or dates as needed.

## Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** [Insert date]

This phone service is operated for personal use only. Your privacy is important, and this policy explains what information is received and how it is handled.

### Information Collected

This service does **not** actively collect, store, or track personal data.

The only information that may be received is what is automatically provided through **Caller ID**, which can include:

* Incoming phone number
* Caller name (if supplied by the caller’s carrier)

No additional data is collected beyond what is delivered as part of a normal phone call.

### How Information Is Used

Caller ID information is used solely to:

* Identify incoming calls
* Decide whether to answer or return a call

It is **not** used for analytics, marketing, profiling, or monitoring.

### Data Sharing

Caller ID information is **never shared** with anyone, under any circumstances.
It is not sold, transferred, published, or provided to third parties—ever.

### Data Storage

Caller ID information is not stored long-term or maintained in a database. Any information visible during or immediately after a call is incidental to the operation of the phone service.

### Third-Party Services

This service relies on standard telecommunications providers to function. Their handling of data is governed by their own privacy policies.

### Changes to This Policy

If this service changes in a way that affects privacy, this policy will be updated accordingly.

### Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, you may contact the owner of this service directly.
