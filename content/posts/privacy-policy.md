**Effective Date:** 2-7-2026

This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled for the personal messaging and phone service, which is operated by a sole proprietor for personal, low-volume communication purposes only.

### Information Collected

This service does **not** actively collect personal data.

The only information that may be received is what is automatically provided as part of standard phone or SMS delivery, which may include:

* Phone number
* Caller ID name (if provided by the carrier)
* Message content sent by the user
* Basic message metadata required for delivery (such as timestamps)

No additional personal information is requested, collected, or tracked.

### Use of Information

Any information received is used solely to:

* Send and receive person-to-person messages
* Respond to inbound communications
* Operate the phone and messaging service as intended

Information is **not** used for marketing, analytics, profiling, advertising, or automated decision-making.

### Data Sharing

Information is **never sold, shared, rented, or disclosed** to third parties for any purpose.

The only exception is the use of third-party telecommunications providers (such as Twilio) that are necessary to deliver calls and messages. These providers process information only to enable message delivery and are governed by their own privacy and security policies.

### Data Retention

Information is not retained long-term or stored in a separate database. Any data that exists is incidental to normal device, carrier, or service operation.

### User Choices

You may opt out of receiving SMS messages at any time asking me to stop.
For help or additional information, reply asking for help.

### Security

Reasonable measures are taken to prevent unauthorized access to communications within the limits of a personal-use service.

### Children’s Privacy

This service is not directed to children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect information from children.

### Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of any changes.
